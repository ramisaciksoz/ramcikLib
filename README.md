# üîµ 2. Step - Requirements ƒ∞nstallation
---
## Requirements ƒ∞nstallation

## Installation for linux
```python
# main.py

# starts from here!
scriptContent = """#!/bin/bash
missingModule=`python main.py 2>&1 | grep "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named" | awk -F"'" '{print $2}'`;
pip install $missingModule;"""
# Open the file in write mode ('w'), or append mode ('a')
with open('installMissing.sh', 'w') as file:
    file.write(scriptContent)

from AutomationHandler_ramcik import init_tools
init_tools.oc_install_deps()
init_tools.oc_create_myenvfile() # creates a file at $HOME/OmnesCore/myenvfile.env
#ends here 

```
##### run python script 
```bash
# pythonInterpreterPath is python interpreter you mainly use with this library
# If running the code below leaves any modules missing, try running the following 
# bash command to install the missing modules: "chmod +x installMissing.sh; ./installMissing.sh;".
# Then, run the code here again and continue trying until it executes successfully.
sudo pythonInterpreterPath main.py
```

##### if there is missing module run 
```bash
# If there are any modules that fail to load when main.py is run, the following command 
# can be used to complete the installation.
chmod +x installMissing.sh; ./installMissing.sh;
```

## Installation for windows
```python
# main.py

# starts from here!
import os
import subprocess

# Check if dotenv is installed, if not, install it
try:
    import dotenv
except ImportError:
    subprocess.check_call(["pip", "install", "python-dotenv"])

# Continue with the rest of the script after ensuring all dependencies are installed
from AutomationHandler_ramcik import init_tools
init_tools.oc_install_deps()
init_tools.oc_create_myenvfile()  # creates a file at ~/OmnesCore/myenvfile.env in the user's home directory, e.g., C:/Users/Username/OmnesCore/myenvfile.env
# ends here
```
---
# üîµ 3. Step - Define Environment Variables
---

## Edit created myenvfile.env
- Edit created file For Linux =>  $HOME/OmnesCore/myenvfile.env 
- Edit created file For Windows =>  ~/OmnesCore/myenvfile.env in the user's home directory, e.g., C:/Users/Username/OmnesCore/myenvfile.env 


##### CHROME_PRIMARY_WHATSAPP_PROFILE_PATH 
```
For linux;
"CHROME_PRIMARY_WHATSAPP_PROFILE_PATH": "$HOME/OmnesCore/ChromeProfile/primary/profile"

For windows;
"CHROME_PRIMARY_WHATSAPP_PROFILE_PATH": "C:/Users/Username/OmnesCore/ChromeProfile/primary/profile"

Note: You need to check if the file is created in the correct location for the CHROME_PRIMARY_WHATSAPP_PROFILE_PATH variable, then You can just use it as default an skip to step 2.

- This is your whatsapp profile path, if you want to use a different path for primary whatpsapp profile, you can edit this in myenvfile.env as you wish.
```

##### CHROME_SECONDARY_WHATSAPP_PROFILE_PATH

**IMPORTANT**: If you are not going to use `"CHROME_SECONDARY_WHATSAPP_PROFILE_PATH"`, 
it should remain an `empty string` in `myenvfile.env`. But, If you‚Äôre going to use it, we suggest using 
the path¬†provided¬†following.‚ö†Ô∏è

```
For linux;
"CHROME_SECONDARY_WHATSAPP_PROFILE_PATH": "$HOME/OmnesCore/ChromeProfile/secondary/profile"

For windows;
"CHROME_SECONDARY_WHATSAPP_PROFILE_PATH": "C:/Users/Username/OmnesCore/ChromeProfile/secondary/profile"


Note: To send a message to yourself, you can edit this and log in with a different WhatsApp account. 
The main purpose of this is to notify yourself via WhatsApp by sending a message from one WhatsApp account
to your own.

Note-2: Self-notification issues, such as sending a message from the same WhatsApp phone number to itself (which
does not trigger a notification on the phone), are handled by using CHROME_SECONDARY_WHATSAPP_PROFILE_PATH to 
eliminate this issue.

- This is your whatsapp profile path, if you want to use a different path for second whatpsapp profile, you can edit this in myenvfile.env as you wish.
```
##### MY_GMAIL
```
"MY_GMAIL": "example@gmail.com",
your gmail account 
```
##### MY_GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
```
For linux;
"MY_GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "$HOME/OmnesCore/GoogleVisionCredentials.json"

For windows;
"MY_GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "C:/Users/Username/OmnesCore/GoogleVisionCredentials.json"

GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: Path to the JSON file with Google Cloud Vision API 
credentials.
This file can be obtained from the Google Cloud Console:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Enable the Vision API and create a service account.
3. Download the JSON credentials file and set the path as an environment variable:
`os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = os.getenv('MY_GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS')`

```
##### MY_NUMBER
```
"MY_NUMBER": "+1234567890",

Your phone number.

```
##### UCHROME_PROFILE_PATH
```
"UCHROME_PROFILE_PATH": "C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\OmnesCore\\UChromeProfiles\\profile"
The path to your undetected Chrome user profile directory used by automation scripts.

This profile is essential for bypassing bot detection systems (like Cloudflare) by preserving cookies, login sessions, and browser fingerprints between runs.

# üîµ 6. Step - Using SMS Automation
---
## What is SMS Automation?

The `SmsHandler` class lets you **automate Google Messages (messages.google.com)** to check and read SMS content directly from your PC.

> ‚úÖ **Important:**  
> This works by opening **[Google Messages for Web](https://messages.google.com/web)**.  
> You must **link your phone‚Äôs Google Messages app** with your computer by scanning the QR code once.  
> It works just like WhatsApp Web. After pairing, your phone‚Äôs SMS will sync here automatically.

---

## Features

`SmsHandler` currently supports:

- ‚úÖ Checking for an SMS with timestamp ‚ÄúNow‚Äù or ‚Äú≈ûimdi‚Äù and clicking it
- ‚úÖ Selecting the first conversation in your SMS list
- ‚úÖ Getting the text content of the latest received SMS

**Future:** More SMS automation methods will be added to handle full conversation flow.

---

## Example usage

```python
from AutomationHandler_ramcik import oc

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Open Google Messages Web automatically
# Use manuel_giris=True first to log in manually and save session,
# then set manuel_giris=False for next runs to skip manual login.
driver = oc.run_general_bot(
    "https://messages.google.com/web/welcome",
    block_file_name="cloudflare_block_google_sms.txt",
    telegram_tag="me",
    manuel_giris=False  # ‚úÖ Set to True for first-time login!
)

sms_handler = oc.SmsHandler(driver)

if sms_handler.select_sms_with_now_timestamp(timeout=250):
    sms_text = sms_handler.get_last_sms_text_from_conversation(timeout=5)
    print("SMS:", sms_text)

input("Press Enter to exit...")
```

---

## Notes

- üìå **Keep the Messages tab open** ‚Äî your phone must stay connected to the internet.
- üìå After scanning the QR code once, your login stays active unless you log out.
- üìå Using your own Chrome profile helps keep sessions alive between runs.

---

## Extending SMS Automation

You can add your own custom SMS actions as new methods inside `SmsHandler` in your library.  
This keeps your SMS code organized and ready for more automation in the future.
